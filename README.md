# Snake-Game
A simple snake game.
The rules of the game are same to that of the famous 90's classic snake game.
Instead of snake I have used orange coloured squares and the prey of snake is also a square of green color.
After eating the prey the size of the snake increases by ione orange colored square.
And the player loses when the snake collides with its own bpdy or with the boundary of the game window.
